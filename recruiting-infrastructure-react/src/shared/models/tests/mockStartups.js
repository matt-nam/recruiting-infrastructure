Big Tech uses this data to induce dopamine loops to keep us hooked into their platforms; the least we should do is to start reclaiming our data. Create private copies of your internet breadcrumbs, like the links to webpages you found useful, the videos you liked, the songs you listened to, the blogs you left a comment on, and so much more. This is our digital garden, and we can shape it by actively adding anything we like to it - songs, links, locations, pictures, thoughts, and voice notes to shape it. Your data will be stored in a private cloud, reserved only for your use, disconnected from the internet. This is Sidebrain, an app, but in reality a gateway to your digital-address in a decentralized internet, hosted on your private server, that you can choose to completely plug off from the internet or selectively plug back in. Sidebrain will do the job of categorizing, parsing, comprehending and indexing your data on your server to make it searchable and useful. Search is inspired by the neuroscience of the human brain and how it stores and associatively recalls data.",

Khalil, a Stanford graduate student (MBA/MS Education, graduated December 2020) and award-winning social entrepreneur with a decade of experience scaling innovative solutions to thorny societal problems, felt a strong call to action to respond to the impending economic crisis. Khalil convened a group of fellow Stanford grad students to start Gift Card Bank -- a scalable, secure platform that aggregates digital gift cards for essentials and distributes them to those who have seen a precipitous loss of income due to COVID-19. Our mission is to improve well-being and financial security by supporting people through their time of greatest need. We partner with major retailers and merchants to ensure a sustainable supply of gift cards, and with food banks/fintech platforms that have established connections with our target demographic and will refer their clients to us.Why gift cards? We know that direct cash transfers are an incredibly effective tool to combat poverty and support vulnerable populations, yet despite the academic evidence, many donors remain uncomfortable with cash aid. We see gift cards as a bridge to more direct cash aid. Gift cards retain the flexibility of cash, and our hypothesis is that donors who may not be comfortable with direct cash today will value the added transparency inherent in gift card philanthropy. Gift cards have several other important benefits - we have partnerships in place to secure gift cards at discounted prices, which means that every dollar goes further. The majority of our gift card supply to date has come through partnerships with major retailers (Kroger, Albertsons, and CVS).",

                "Blurb": "The idea behind Flux Marine was driven by an unsinkable passion for boating and the environment. Growing up, our hobby was restoring old boats and engines on Lake George, NY. Countless times motors wouldn't start, resulting in weeks of repairs and sometimes even the rest of the summer off the water. We knew there had to be a better way.\nÔÇï\nInspiration came when we saw electrification in the automotive industry. Automakers were proving that performance, reliability, and sustainability no longer had to be mutually exclusive. While studying engineering at Princeton, Ben Sorkin found the Princeton lab for electrochemical energy systems research and dove into the world of battery technology. This led him to work at Tesla, where the technology vision for a better boat motor was stengthened. \n \nThe first step was to build a prototoype. We scraped together money to build our very first proof of concept in 2015 during a summer research program at Princeton University. That protoype almost broke an electric world speed record - we knew we had something. Several years of research followed as we worked to perfect our technology.\nÔÇï\nIn 2018, we officially incorporated and tirelessly worked to build additional prototypesÔÇï and prove the business viability of electric propulsion in the marine industry. We won some of the nation's top business plan competitions and competitive prizes. Through a ground-up design and innovative technology suite, we developed a product that challenges the norms of electric as slow and boating unreliable and expensive. We put our 30 HP technology demonstrator on our 1961 Glasspar G3 ski boat which ran better than the old 100 HP Merc Tower of Power we restored growing up. Not only did the boat move at 25 knots, but you can actually pull a skier because of the torque.  \nÔÇï\nWe didn't stop there. Our focus has been towards developing additional outboard models and refining them to commercial quality. Our mission is to develop marine propulsion systems characterized by performance, scalability and dependability. Our product is a complete system comprising an outboard motor, battery, and control set. Ranging in power from 15 to 70HP+, our systems are suitable for diverse applications across the boating industry.\n \nWe look forward to you being a part of our story.",

Khalil, a Stanford graduate student (MBA/MS Education, graduated December 2020) and award-winning social entrepreneur with a decade of experience scaling innovative solutions to thorny societal problems, felt a strong call to action to respond to the impending economic crisis. Khalil convened a group of fellow Stanford grad students to start Gift Card Bank -- a scalable, secure platform that aggregates digital gift cards for essentials and distributes them to those who have seen a precipitous loss of income due to COVID-19. Our mission is to improve well-being and financial security by supporting people through their time of greatest need. We partner with major retailers and merchants to ensure a sustainable supply of gift cards, and with food banks/fintech platforms that have established connections with our target demographic and will refer their clients to us.Why gift cards? We know that direct cash transfers are an incredibly effective tool to combat poverty and support vulnerable populations, yet despite the academic evidence, many donors remain uncomfortable with cash aid. We see gift cards as a bridge to more direct cash aid. Gift cards retain the flexibility of cash, and our hypothesis is that donors who may not be comfortable with direct cash today will value the added transparency inherent in gift card philanthropy. Gift cards have several other important benefits - we have partnerships in place to secure gift cards at discounted prices, which means that every dollar goes further. The majority of our gift card supply to date has come through partnerships with major retailers (Kroger, Albertsons, and CVS).",
